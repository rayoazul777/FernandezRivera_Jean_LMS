The GUI should now follow these steps.

Your GUI should execute the following tasks:

Ask the user for a file name, and receive it from the user.  Open the file supplied by the user, and add each book to the LMS database.  Display an error message if the file was not found.
Print the database to the screen.
Ask the user for a barcode number to remove.  Receive the barcode, remove the corresponding book from the database, and print a confirmation message that the book was deleted.  Display an error message if the barcode was not found.
Ask the user for a title number to remove.  Receive the title, remove the corresponding book from the database, and print a confirmation message that the book was deleted. Display an error message if the title was not found.
Ask the user for a title to check out. Check out the book, and print a confirmation message.  Display an error message if the book is already checked out.
Ask the user for a title to check in. Check in the book, and print a confirmation message.
Don't forget to add an Exit button so that users can leave the GUI when finished!
